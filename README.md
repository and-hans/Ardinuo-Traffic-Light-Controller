# Ardinuo-Traffic-Light
Title says it all. Made a traffic light with the help of an Arduino Uno board, some resistors (10 ohms I believe), some LEDs, a breadboard, and lots of cardboard.

One streets traffic lights turns green, including a pedestrian light that turns on, while the other streets light is red. After a bit, the yellow light turns on for the intersection that had the green light on, and then it turns red. A bit later, the intersection that previously had the red light turns to green light, with it's pedestrian light turning on as well. The cycle then goes on and on.



Warning:
- I made this a VERY long time ago, so:
  1. I forgot the resources I used off the internet, so I can't cite much.
  2. Some of the comments may not be right (as long as it worked, I was fine with it).
  3. Yes I could have used functions and pointers, but I did not know it at that time.
  4. It worked... somehow.


I should probably use TinkerCAD or Simulink to show the circuit at work; so I'll just put it on my to-do list and definitely not start a new project (lol).

UPDATE: Heres the TinkerCAD [link](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/2XTvQsSqxNO) to view what it should look like (and also be confused as to why I connected the middle junctions but seperated the left and right ones to their own pins). Just press "Simulate" near the play button, and then "Start Simulation", at the top, to watch it work.
