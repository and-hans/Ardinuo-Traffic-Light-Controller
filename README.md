# Ardinuo-Traffic-Light-Controller
Title says it all. Made a traffic light with the help of an Arduino Uno board, some resistors, some LEDs, and lots of cardboard.

Warning:
- I made this a VERY long time ago, so:
  1. I forgot the resources I used off the internet, so I can't cite much.
  2. Some of the comments may not be right (as long as it worked, I was fine with it).
  3. It worked... somehow.
